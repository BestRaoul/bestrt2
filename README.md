## a blender inspired miniRT

Hey, this is my mini raytracer project.
It is a plenty featured raytracer built with mlx the school 42 window library based on X11.

## Features
  - Physically based rendering
  - Texture support (normal maps, albedo, metalic, specular, transmission, roughness, emission)
  - Image based lighting
  - RT format loading and in-app modification
  - BMP export
  - Animation rendering .webm

## lacks
  - multi-threading, processing and GPU usage
  - built-in denoising
  - RT format saving
  - ambient occlusion
  - soft shadows
  - proper cubemapping
  - volumetric rendering
  - Triangle rendering and .obj import
  - Optimizations
      1. BVH
      2. aabb
      3. smart sampling

Anyway, even with all those features missing it can render some relatively realistic images
