## a blender inspired miniRT

Hey, this is my mini raytracer project.
It is a plenty featured raytracer built with mlx the school 42 window library based on X11.

## Features
  . Physically based rendering
  . Texture support (normal maps, albedo, metalic, specular, transmission, roughness, emission)
  . Image based lighting
  . RT format loading and in-app modification
  . BMP export
  . Animation rendering .webm

## lacks
  . multi-threading, processing and GPU usage
  . built-in denoising
  . RT format saving
  . ambient occlusion
  . soft shadows
  . proper cubemapping
  . volumetric rendering
  . Triangle rendering and .obj import
  . Optimizations
    . BVH
    . aabb
    . smart sampling

Anyway, even with all those features missing it can render some relatively realistic images
